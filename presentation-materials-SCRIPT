Hello everyone. Today our group will present about the impact of ChatGPT on society in 2024 and 2025. ChatGPT has become one of the most widely used AI tools in the world, influencing education, business, and everyday communication.
Speaker 2:
 Over the past year, ChatGPT has reached hundreds of millions of active users and has been integrated into tools like Microsoft Office and various enterprise platforms. Companies use it to automate writing, summarize documents, generate ideas, and support customer service. In education, students and teachers rely on it for explanations, studying, and language learning.
Speaker 3:
 ChatGPT also brings a lot of benefits. It increases productivity, helps people create written content faster, improves accessibility for those with disabilities or language barriers, and supports learning through personalized explanations. It also boosts creativity by helping generate ideas, drafts, and examples for different tasks.
Speaker 1:
However, ChatGPT also has important risks. These include misinformation, biased content, job displacement in writing and analysis roles, and concerns about privacy and data usage. Another major issue is over-reliance on AI tools for decision-making, which may affect how people think and process information.
Speaker 2:
 Looking ahead, the influence of ChatGPT will continue to grow as AI becomes more integrated into society. We expect stronger regulations, more advanced models, and increased collaboration between humans and AI. The main challenge is finding a balance between innovation and safety.
Speaker 3:
 We would like to end our presentation with a question for discussion:
 Do you think society will become too dependent on AI tools like ChatGPT for important decisions?
